# Tap Room with React
#### _Andrew Lupton, 6/29/2018_

## Description

_This app uses the React library to render a refactored version of an Angular app for a keg list at a nonexistent tap room or bar_

## Diagram

## Known Bugs
_This web app is currently under development._

## Notes

Working through issues relating to how the app will function dynamically. Thus far, Angular seems to be more useful for modeling data, whereas React shortens the routing and rendering process.

## Setup

Clone the repository from Github, navigate to the project directory in your terminal, execute `npm install`, execute `npm run start` and then navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser to view the app.
